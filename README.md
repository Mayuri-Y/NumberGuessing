# NumberGuessing

A number guessing system, often referred to as a "Number Guessing Game" or "Guess the Number," is a simple and entertaining project that can be implemented in various programming languages. The goal of the game is for the player to guess a random number within a specified range. The system provides feedback to the player to help them narrow down their guesses until they correctly identify the target number.

Here's a basic project description for a number guessing system:

Project Title: Number Guessing System

Project Description:
Create a command-line or graphical user interface (GUI) number guessing game where the computer generates a random number within a predefined range, and the player's task is to guess that number. The system will provide feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The player continues to guess until they correctly identify the number, and the system records the number of attempts it took.
